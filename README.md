# Digital Modular Synthesizer

## How to run

1. Open the `patchbay demo.scd` file in SuperCollider. Run the code in the first parenthetical block. A window will appear with the GUI for the synthesizer.
2. If you want to change the set up of the various modules, you can add/remove lines of code that start with `Module(...` in this file (after line 97). This can be seen in the `three filters and three oscillators.scd` file.
3. Presets are stored in:
`'/Users/usr/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider'` under `module presets` and `module midi maps`

## Notes

This is a project that was used in my Experiments in Sound and Technology class, where our professor, Ron Kuvila taught us how to use SuperCollider and helped us create a basic modular synthesizer.
